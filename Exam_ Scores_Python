# A student enters an exam score (as a floating-point value).  

# The exam score must be between 0 and 100.  The program will enforce the domain of an exam score.
#once the score has been validated, The program will display the score followed by the appropriate letter grade 
# (assume a 10-point grading scale).
#The score will be displayed as a floating-point number with one value to the right of the decimal point.
# Score 89.9           Grade B


#Once a score has been processed, the program will ask the user if he or she wishes to enter another grade.  
#The program will continue entering grades until the user chooses to stop.  
#Once the user selects stop, the program will display the following:

#Highest Exam Score entered:  99.9

#Lowest Exam Score entered:   99.9

#Average Exam Score………..:   99.9

#CANNOT:
#Use global variables
#Use the word goto
