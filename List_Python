# create a list of exam scores 500. The exam scores will be randomly generated. 
#Exam scores shall range from 0.0 and 100.0.  
#After loading the list, you are to compute and display the following, in the following order

#1.The highest and lowest exam score along with the number of times the high and low scores appear in the list.
#2. You are to output the number of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s
#3.You are to write a function that will delete all F scores from the list
#4.You are to write a function that will adjust all exam scores in the list by 5.5 points 
# while doing this, you must make sure that no score is above 100.0.
#5.You are to create a sideways bar chart for all scores in the list.
# Line number each bar and include a numeric label at the end of each bar.  
# Make sure all line number periods line up.
